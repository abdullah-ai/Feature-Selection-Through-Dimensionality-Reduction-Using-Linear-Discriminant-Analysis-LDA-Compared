Feature Selection Through Dimensionality Reduction Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Compared with Principal Component Analysis PCA

Both LDA and PCA are linear transformation techniques: LDA is a supervised whereas PCA is unsupervised â€“ PCA ignores class labels.

We can picture PCA as a technique that finds the directions of maximal variance

In contrast to PCA, LDA attempts to find a feature subspace that maximizes class separability
